a. Design and Test cases -
Design -
I am using the below libraries in order to achieve the test framework -
1. requests - This python library is being used to work with api requests in python.
2. pytest - This library is a python testing framework using assert statements and can be run in batch mode from command line 

Test cases are as below -
1. Test the http response
2. Test whether the response is taking less than a second to come back
3. Test whether we are getting the latest hourly updates
4. Test whether the values on temperatures are not empty
